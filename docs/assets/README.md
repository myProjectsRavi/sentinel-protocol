`sentinel-hero.gif` is the top-of-README hero media file.

Replace it with a high-quality recording before public launch:

1. Record a short terminal/dashboard session (traffic flowing + injection blocked).
2. Convert to GIF (asciinema, ffmpeg, or Screen Studio export).
3. Save as `docs/assets/sentinel-hero.gif`.

Recommended target:
- Duration: 8-15 seconds
- Size: <= 12 MB
- Width: 1280 px
