# Sentinel Protocol v1.0.0

Sentinel Protocol v1.0.0 is the first production-grade release of the local AI governance firewall.

## Highlights

- Budget Enforcer:
  - Deterministic local cost guardrails and daily kill-switch controls.
  - Stream and buffered usage accounting with audit visibility.
- Resilience Mesh (Phase A/B):
  - Safe failover across provider groups with conservative semantics.
  - Cross-provider adapter contracts (`openai_chat_v1` to Anthropic/Google).
- Canary A/B Routing:
  - Sticky deterministic traffic splits with route observability headers.
- Security Hardening:
  - DNS-rebinding-resistant custom target routing (IP pinning + Host/SNI preservation).
  - Hop-by-hop header scrubbing and strict config validation.
  - Worker-thread scanning to keep the event loop responsive.
- Reliability:
  - Circuit breaker + retry diagnostics on every failure path.
  - Graceful shutdown and audit flush behavior.
  - Stream budget accounting for both `end` and `error` paths.

## Operator Signals

- Route headers:
  - `x-sentinel-route-target`
  - `x-sentinel-route-group`
  - `x-sentinel-route-contract`
  - `x-sentinel-route-source`
- Failover headers:
  - `x-sentinel-failover-used`
  - `x-sentinel-failover-count`
  - `x-sentinel-failover-chain`
- Upstream diagnostics:
  - `x-sentinel-error-source`
  - `x-sentinel-upstream-error`
  - `x-sentinel-provider`
  - `x-sentinel-retry-count`
  - `x-sentinel-circuit-state`
  - `x-sentinel-correlation-id`

## Release Notes (copy-ready)

Sentinel Protocol v1.0.0 ships the reference architecture for local AI firewalling:

- deterministic policy enforcement
- PII and injection defense on ingress + egress
- budget kill-switch controls
- resilience mesh failover + sticky canary routing
- cross-provider adapter contracts
- hardened Docker defaults with model preloading

This release is designed to run local-first, fail safely, and stay observable under real production traffic.
